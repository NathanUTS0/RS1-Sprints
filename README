Robotics Project Documentation
Overview
This project covers multiple aspects of robotics, including SLAM, path planning, and robot navigation in a simulated environment. Below is a brief overview of the learning outcomes and project requirements.

SLO 1: Problem Identification and Scope
Stakeholder Engagement: Include progress updates with stakeholders, including meeting dates, names, and discussion summaries.
SLO 2: Design Thinking for Robotics
SLAM & Path Planning Context: Describe how SLAM and path planning contribute to the project, including their benefits.
SLO 3: Technical Skills Application
SLAM Description: Define SLAM, why it's important, sensors used, challenges, and popular techniques in ROS.
SLAM Demonstration: Show SLAM in Gazebo, remote control robot to generate a map, and overlay it on the Gazebo map. Challenges must be documented.
Computation Analysis: Analyze the computation time for the SLAM task in the report.
Path Planning Description: Briefly explain path planning and its challenges, and list three types of algorithms.
Path Planning Demonstration: Show path planning in Gazebo using a generated map. Discuss the challenges faced.
Object Exclusion in Mapping: Write a ROS node to identify and exclude a cylindrical object using laser scans.
SLO 4: Collaboration and Communication
Time Management: Demonstrate successful completion of all Sprint 3 tasks.
GitHub Repository: Provide a link to the repository in the report.
Documentation: Produce a well-formatted project portfolio and code documentation using Doxygen.
Repository
This repository includes:

Source code for SLAM and path planning tasks.
ROS nodes and scripts for simulation in Gazebo.
Documentation generated with Doxygen.
